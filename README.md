# ReviewsWithFlask
A simple movie review web application using Flask and SQLite
This web app shows off Flask route skills, there is no verification or sanitiztion
To test it out one need to have python3 installed and the flask module
Create a new SQLite database (.db extension) file with the same name as in the setup.py (reviewData.db)
Run the Flask webserver locally:
within the directory of the project assign the global FLASK_APP to the file to run (export FLASK_APP=app.py, which is the name of the main file in the project)
You should be good to go and run flask with *flask run* command
then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which is the default localhost/port for flask
